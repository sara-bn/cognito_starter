# AWS FINAL ASSIGNMENT
In this project I have used Cognito Identity Service for user registration and authentication. When a user is authenticated, they can view an "Cat" page, which is a list of cat which is stored in a database. If the user is not authenticated, the cat page is not accessible.

## Cognito Identity Service
We have integrate the AWS Cognito service into a React app in class.
* Create a react app with required components and form validation
* Configure AWS Cognito and Integrate into React App
  * Create user pool
  * Connect the Cognito User Pool to React
  * Add domain to user pool

## API
I have created a AWS hosted MySQL database using the AWS RDS Service along with Lambda Functions to interact with the database.
Then by using the database and Lambda Functions while using the AWS API Gateway, I have made a local React client app.
In order to store images I have used S3 and gave public access to my objects
Here is the screenshots of from my aws account:
